# Congestion Pricing Safety Analysis
## Overview
This project evaluates the impact of Manhattan's congestion pricing program, implemented in January 2025, on traffic safety. Using crash data from NYC OpenData (2012â€“2025), 
it analyzes changes in crashes, injuries, and fatalities within and outside the Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ). The findings include visualizations of trends, comparative analyses,
and spatial heatmaps to demonstrate the program's effectiveness.

## Features
Crash Trend Analysis: Yearly and monthly trends from 2012 to 2025.
Pre- and Post-Intervention Comparison: Examines crash metrics before and after January 2025.
Spatial Analysis: Heatmaps showing crash density changes in key areas.
Insights: Quantitative findings highlight reductions in crashes, injuries, and fatalities both in and out of the CRZ.

## Data
Dataset Source: NYC OpenData - Motor Vehicle Collisions.
Metrics Used:
Total crashes.
Total injuries.
Total fatalities.

## Key Results
Crashes: Reduced by ~22% in the CRZ and ~15% outside it (Jan 2025 vs. prior periods).
Injuries: Declined by ~20% in the CRZ and ~17% outside it.
Fatalities: Dropped by 100% in the CRZ and 40% outside it.
Technologies Used
Python for data cleaning and visualization (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Geospatial Analysis: Heatmaps to visualize spatial trends.
Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data exploration.
